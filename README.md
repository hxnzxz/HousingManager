# My Personal Project
This application will run as an exclusive online 
housing market for both renting and listings. The usage
is directed to both potential tenants and owners, where
tenants can browse for available housings from anywhere.
Listings will show location, a provided image and base 
pricing in (rent/month). I think this is a project I can
dedicate my interests to as housing is not only an issue
I face, but many other UBC students as well. Be it rent
is too high, or searching across many websites/services
is too tedious and occasionally outdated. This will also 
to keep track of when rent is due, or for potential
tenants;when house viewings have been scheduled.
